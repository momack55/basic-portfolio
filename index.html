        <p> My Name is Morgan McCormack and I am very excited to begin a new career as a developer! </p> 

        <p> Let me start by explaining a little bit about myself, I went to college at Valdosta State University and I have a Bachelors of Science in Psychology. After graduating I realized that although I found psychology very interesting and something that I loved learning about
            it wasn't exactly something that I wanted to do with my life. I decided to move to the great city of Nashville and got a job working for Marriott at the Gaylord Opryland Resort. 5 years later, I am still working in accounting at the Gaylord Opryland Resort but it is not something that I can see myself doing longterm. I started looking into some other options and decided to learn more about 
            programming and coding. Once I realized that it was something I really enjoyed doing, I decided there is no time like the present to start working towards my new goal.
